For this challenge your task is, given a number N, rearrange the numbers 1 to N so that all adjacent pairs of numbers sum up to square numbers.

There might not actually be a solution. There also might be multiple solution. You are only required to find one, if possible.

For example, the smallest number for which this is possbile is 15:

8 1 15 10 6 3 13 12 4 5 11 14 2 7 9

 8 +  1 =  9 = 3^2
 1 + 15 = 16 = 4^2
15 + 10 = 25 = 5^2
10 +  6 = 16 = 4^2
...

Example Input

15
